- 🤖 **Treat Ana as you would a coworker**
    - Have interactive conversations to clarify or refine requests, just as you would with a real analyst.

- 🧩 **Break complex requests into smaller steps**
    - Language models can get overwhelmed when given too many steps at once.

- ❓ **Ask follow-up questions**
    - This helps uncover deeper insights or correct misunderstandings along the way.

- 📈 **Request charts and visualizations**
    - These can be easy ways to understand data and insights, as well as verify Ana's assumptions.

- ❗ **Expect occasional misunderstandings or assumptions**
    - Ana might interpret questions differently, so be prepared to rephrase or specify your request when needed.

- 🔄 **If a chat gets too long or isn't going well, start fresh**
    - Ana has access to many tools and may stumble when handling too many things at once. Sometimes, the best solution is to start a new chat.

**Something isn’t working / my team needs specialized onboarding / we need more datasets. How can I get in touch?**
