The Textable is a high-performance interface for tabular data, regardless of where it lives. As a unified interface for working with large datasets, it simplifies work by providing a shared format for many purposes:

- Loading datasets to Python sandboxes
- Performing paginated queries for previews
- Performing statistical analysis on large datasets

With the textables format, weâ€™ve created an interface within the platform that ensures the agent is equipped with a common set of tooling across different data tabular data sources. Textables make it so that the amount of additional work to incorporate an additional connection at the data layer is minimal.
