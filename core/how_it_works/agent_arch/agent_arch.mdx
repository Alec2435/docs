<Warning>The docs in this section are rather intricate and technical, and they focus mainly on how Ana works as opposed to how to set-up TextQL or work with Ana. TextQL users without technical experience should feel free to skip this section, as the information here won't contribute to a better usage experience.</Warning>

TextQL has developed a controllable insights agent for tabular data. Achieving this required extensive research and the development of a robust architecture that integrates multiple foundational concepts. This architecture is designed to prioritize reliability while addressing the challenges of context management.

TextQL’s main technology is the Ana (Analyst) agent, which is a chatbot architecture for extracting insights from tabular data.  The agent’s capabilities are underpinned by five key technologies:

- **Dakota:** A state-machine architecture that manages tool access at runtime. Dakota enables dynamic prompt adjustments and context integration before agent processing.

- **Sandbox Execution Environment:** A secure environment for loading tabular data into memory and executing AI-generated Python scripts for analysis.

- **Ontology Service (TextQL Semantic Layer):** A semantic framework for defining and connecting data areas. Ontology objects are vectorized, allowing the agent to efficiently locate and operate on relevant data within a client’s data warehouse.

- **Textables:** A standardized metadata format for tabular data, providing essential information to guide the agent’s analysis.

- **Chat Engine & Cells:** A layered architecture for managing data-driven conversations through a cell-based processing system. Four layers (LLM, State, History, Stream) provide model-agnostic AI integration and cross-platform delivery, Cells act as atomic units of conversation, supporting both executable operations (search, metrics, analysis) and interactive elements (clarification, choices, assumptions).
