# Overview
The Connectors page is where technical users can manage the sources that TextQL can access.

This page is very incomplete. Please contact us over Slack if more information is needed.

## Structured Data Connectors
Data Warehouse connectors. Currently, TextQL supports:
* Amazon Redshift
* PostgresQL databases
* Snowflake

To add a new warehouse:
1. Click 'Create New Connector'
2. Under 'Warehouses', select the type of warehouse you want to connect
3. Fill out the connection details and submit
4. In order to start using the warehouse, click the 'Sync' button to load the table schema into TextQL

## BI Tools
Dashboards. Currently, only Tableau is supported

## Unstructured Data Connectors
Documentation. Currently, only Confluence and flat text files are supported, with Alation support in limited beta testing.
